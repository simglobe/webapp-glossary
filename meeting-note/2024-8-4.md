Two topics: Chart design and help page
- Chart design:
	- Allows for combo charts and multiple legends 
	- Multiple charts are now combined into one to summarize information. Chart layout is no longer bento grid.
	- The Status board is now renamed Dashboard
	- The Detailed panel is now renamed Inspect Panel
	- When a Dashboard is clicked on, its respective legends are shown in a bento grid in Inspect Panel
	- The current value for the main variable (legend) of each Dashboard chart is shown  to the right of chart, similar to the download status page in Steam
	- Additionally, Approval Index and its 4 components will have their own doughnut progress bar with the current value in the center 
- Help page:
	- Glossary is now renamed Help page
	- Help page has bidirectional link
	- Help page is shown in a separate browser window 
- Model
