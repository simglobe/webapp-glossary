Consensus:
- The basic tutorial should be more formal 
- There should only be one quiz 
- Remove SimCoin and use USD. Use nominal exchange rate to make it (1) easier to understand the concept of exchange rate, (2) easier to appreciate the change in exchange rate. SimCoin is confusing + difficult to remember. 
- More graphical elements to make the message more vivid.

Task:
- Rewrite the introduction for the navigation minigame 
- Come up with new questions for the quiz
- Collect newest data for USD/LCU exchange rate
