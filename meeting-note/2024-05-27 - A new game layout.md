- The current layout of the game is deficient: 
	- (Bao) The old layout has double layers, which is frequently used in game. The bottom layer is the map with a dark background, and the upper layer is where the boards will live. This layout is frequently used in resource management game where the map is a core mechanics that players have to frequently interact with. It is inappropriate for the game because (1) map is not a core mechanics as others are equally important to SimGlobe, and (2) it is not the style of a terminal which should have a flat structure.
	- (Bao) The new layout strives for a flat hierarchy, where information is always available whenever the players need them. It proves to be more economical, utilitarian, and professional than the old layout, which suits the role of a policymaker. 
- Details of the new layout are debated in this meeting:
	-  Some aspects of the UI are renamed:
		- Status board -> Dashboard
		- Detailed status board -> Detail board
		- Game environment -> **The terminal**
		- The graph -> Cards
	- Some new aspects of the UI are suggested:
		-  The Dashboard will have two mode: Domestic-Inspect mode, and Global-Compare mode. The Domestic-Inspect mode will be for (1) displaying all information about an economy, and (2) side-by-side comparison with specific economies. The Global-Compare mode will be for comparing between all economies at once for selected variables, which have been suggested to be related to Section 1 - Approval Index, Section 5 - Trade, and Section 6 - Policy.
	- How the users interact with the game is reimagined:
		- The Dashboard will not only consist of line graphs alone. This is because that is wasting a lot of valuable real estate. Some of the variables will be combined to deliver more information in less space. 
		- Players can interact with the map. Specifically, players can choose a country to see its dashboard on the left and the extra information right over the map. There is also a toggle for multiple selection where players can choose what countries they want to see a side-by-side comparison for in the Detail board.
		- Glossary, policy, and message, like before will have their own dedicated spaces on the right of the screen. However there are two different ideas on how to organize them: (1) Glossary will have its own space, while policy control and message will be tabbed right below it, and (2) no tabs and each will have 3 separate spaces. The layout of the two approaches is shown below:

- In the overtime period when Bao has left, Binh suggested that flattening the hierarchy may not be necessary as online examples show that Ui typically follows the double-layer approach. It is only necessary to reorganize/reposition/tab the different boards. Further discussion is needed. 
Task:
- Binh: Mockup for the new idea that Binh suggested
