Today Daniel is not available. Material information for report includes:
- The model is bug-free stage 1. Further testing is needed is ensure the model is correct with heterogenous input and country type
- Backend has been coded. Deployment requires financial backing

Given the backend has been done, further work for the game includes:
- Model adjustments
	- Changing the initial presets and parameters
	- Limit the number of parameters that the room master can adjust
- Writing
	- Country introduction 
	- Model documentation
	- Variable introduction 
	- Warning messages 
	- Glossary
- Miscellaneous:
	- Replacement of 5 country names

Future discussion points:
Currently the adjustment of parameters is a tedious task. We can automate it by using real data to fit the model. The issue is that the real world has about 183 countries trading with each other, while the number of countries in the model can be adjusted and limited to 50. This means that if we want the model to be correct, there needs to 183 countries. How Triet proposes to solve this is to make a bot for the other 133 countries.
