## Country Information

-       US:

United States of America is the largest economy in the world, with a population of ~400 million people. The US economy is known to be the leading force in technological advancements with Silicon Valley at the forefront. This is thanks to a cultural appreciation for risk-taking and innovation fostering a vibrant startup ecosystem and leading to the birth of countless successful businesses that contribute to job creation and economic growth. To supply this growth, the US has one of the best education systems in the world which gives grants and financial aids to international researchers and students to attract talents to the country. Aiding the rise of the US economy is a sophisticated financial system headquartered in Wall Street, New York which acts as an multinational investment fund and a facilitator of global trade.

Despite its achievements, the US economy has been increasingly challenged by multiple issues, among which are rising inequality, growing public debts, political division, expensive healthcare system, and geopolitical rivalry with China, which pose a web of issues that legislators need to carefully navigate.

-       Japan

Japan emerged as the leader of the Asian growth miracle in 80s’ to become the first big Asian economy. Like many other developed economies in the world, it too boasts a high level of technological advancement in regards to the field of robotics and automation. It also excels in manufacturing sophisticated products like semiconductors, optical instruments, and precision machinery, which forms the basis of its trade-oriented economy. Part of the rise of Japan can be attributed to a strong work ethics where employees are expected to be committed and work long hours. Combined with a strong education system and high investment in infrastructure, there is an adequate supply of high-skilled labor and efficient economic activities.

Nevertheless, Japan’s growth has been stumped since the 1990s housing bubble, a period commonly termed “The Lost Decade” of Japan. Since then, Japan’s growth and inflation have remained terminally low at 1% each, which are further challenged by an increasingly aging population, protectionist policies, and high public debts.

-       China

China is currently the second-largest economy and the most populous country in the world. The economy is known to be a popular destination for FDI thanks to a large supply of cheap low-skilled labor, allowing it to become one of the largest “workshops” in the world. Its large population also offers a fertile consumer market, creating internal demand for its products and services and buffering against external economic shocks. China’s economic development strategy is to invest in infrastructure, housing and R&D into cutting-edge technologies such as AI, semiconductors and renewable energy to create jobs, support economic activities, and lead the world in digital technologies.

However, China is also facing seismic structural issues of its economy, including trade reliance, high debts, economic inequality, environmental degradation, political uncertainty and lack of transparency, and aging population. Currently, China is in a recession due to a combination of housing bubble collapse, municipal debt defaults, and global economic downturns.

Under the Compact of Free Association, the country is also known for its reliance on US foreign aid for development. With a weak economy, the public sector plays a huge role in the economy, employing more than one half of the population and contributing 40% to the GDP. Its major source of incomes comes from the sales of fishing rights and taxes on offshore corporation registrations.

3.     Cabo Verde

Cabo Verde or Cape Verde is an archipelago and a small island country in the West of Africa, consisting of 10 volcanic islands.

The economy is service-dominated, where commerce, transport, and public services account for 70% of GDP, of which tourism contributing more than a third. Agriculture and fishing comprises 9% of GDP, and the rest is from light manufacturing, especially seafood processing and cold storage.

In terms of natural resources, the country has the Orange River Basin and a large diamond reserves. In 1986, the Lesotho government commensed Lesotho Highlands Water Project which aims to store and divert the water from the Orange River to South Africa for energy production and water supply. With this project Lesotho is nearly completely self-sufficient in energy production and earns a substantial amount of income from the sale of electricity and water to South Africa. The country is also home to diamond mines, of which the Letseng mine is considered one of the richest mine in the world. The country is currently still plagued by poverty and corruption,

* Honduras 
**Honduras**,[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras#cite_note-8) officially the **Republic of Honduras**,[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras#cite_note-9) is a country in [Central America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America "Central America").

Land appears to be plentiful and readily exploitable, but the nation's rugged, mountainous terrain apparently restricts large-scale agricultural production to narrow strips on the coasts and to a few fertile valleys. Honduras's manufacturing sector has not yet developed beyond simple textile and agricultural processing industries and assembly operations. The country's economy has been majorly disrupted by Hurricane Mitch and COVID-19.
