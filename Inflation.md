## Theory 

In history, inflation and deflation interlaces with each other through booms and busts, and consistently positive inflation is only a modern phenomenon thanks to the emergence of central banks. The cause of inflation in general can be grouped into three categories: demand-pull, cost-push, and inflation expectation ([RBA n.d.](https://www.rba.gov.au/education/resources/explainers/causes-of-inflation.html)).

- Demand-pull means inflation due to an abrupt change in demand relative to supply. An example of this is a spike of inflation post-COVID due to excess stimulus packages and low interest rat. These policies build up purchasing power, which were unleashed following the lift of the lockdown mandate. There is also demand-pull deflation too, such as the period following the 2008 financial crisis where monetary tightening has pushed demand downward.
- Cost-push, on the other hand, means inflation due to an abrupt change in supply relative to demand. Using the COVID example again, inflation is also caused by the breakdown of the supply chain. War or natural disasters which disrupt production are also listed in this category, such as the oil crisis in 1973 and 1979 due to conflicts in the Middle East whose effects ripple throughout the world. 
- Inflation expectation can be considered as a combination of the two. The principle is that as people expect inflation, they will act in such a way that will maintain that level of inflation. For example, if people expect 5%, they will demand at least a 5% increase in wage rates to maintain their purchasing power. For firms to preserve their margin, they will also rise their prices by 5%, effectively strengthening that 5% inflation trend. 

In general, inflation is bad because it erodes purchasing power, especially high inflation. Although deflation has the opposite effect which is strengthening the purchasing power, it also discourages consumption. If price on the whole decrease, consumers would want to delay their purchase to have a cheaper deal. To make the products more attractive, business are forced to lower the price which strengthens the downward trend of the price level. Furthermore, as the trend extends, some business may quit as it is unprofitable to keep lowering price to compete which hampers economic growth. 


Although inflation is bad because it erodes purchasing power, central banks still use a 2% inflation rate as their target.Inflation is bad because it erodes purchasing power. Nonetheless, central banks are willing to tolerate a 2% inflation rate, a
Although high inflation is bad because it erodes purchasing power, deflation is also bad because it can self-fulfilling. If price on the whole decreases, people will wait for it to continue decreasing. Business are forced to lower prices, further fueling the trend. This might become unsustainable, and after some time, businesses default on their debt, decreasing the supply and contributing to the deflation. To avoid this, most central banks set an annual inflation target of 2% to prevent the loss of purchasing power, anchor expectation, and encourage demand. It also provides a 2% "damper" against deflation, which allows time for central bank to react and policy to take effect ([ECB n.d.](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/strategy/pricestab/html/index.en.html)).

## Implementation in the game

In keeping with theory, inflation in the game is a function of new purchasing power, defined as the increase in Income, and the amount of reinvestment of business, defined as the increase in Output. Using the AD-AS model, they shift their corresponding curves, from which we obtain the new equilibrium price level and nominal output. The elasticity of the two curves are set by parameters. The gap between the old and new price level are "markup" to the baseline inflation, which is last period inflation and acts as inflation expectation.
