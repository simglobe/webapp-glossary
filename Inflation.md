# Brief description

Inflation is the growth rate of price level, which is basically the growth rate of demand relative to supply. Keep it low and positive by balancing the growth of Income and Output.
# Long description

## 1. Why do prices go up all the time?

In history, inflation and deflation interlaces with each other through booms and busts, and consistently positive inflation is only a modern phenomenon due to the regulation of currency by central banks. The cause of inflation in general can be grouped into three categories: demand-pull, cost-push, and inflation expectation ([RBA n.d.](https://www.rba.gov.au/education/resources/explainers/causes-of-inflation.html)).

- Demand-pull: Inflation in this case is the result of an abrupt change in aggregate demand relative to supply. An example of this is high inflation in the post-COVID period, where shored up income in the pandemic due to fiscal stimulus are suddenly discharged following the lift of lockdown measure, which pushes aggregate demand up faster than aggregate supply can meet. An opposite example is low inflation such as those after the 2008 Financial Crisis, as the confidence level of investors dropped and there's no spending in the economy, lowering demand relative to supply. 
- Cost-push: Inflation is now the result of an abrupt change in aggregate supply due to increase in production cost. Returning to the example of COVID, the global lockdown has led to the collapse of the supply chain, where ports and inventories were incapacitated by incoming freights undistributed. This means that supply is lower than prior to COVID, which further drives prices up. Another worthy mention is the [[stagflation]] of 1970s, where geopolitical conflicts in the Arab world has led to the instability of global oil supply, leading to sky-high inflation. 
- Inflation [[expectation]]: Apart from demand and supply, there is also the expectation of inflation which acts as a "self-fulfilling prophecy". Suppose that the economy expects 5% inflation. Labor will therefore demand at least a 5% wage increase to maintain their purchasing power. Firms, in tandem, will also raise prices by roughly 5% to preserve their margin. 
## 2. 2% is all you need 

Although in general, inflation hurts as it erodes purchasing power, central banks tolerate and in fact adopt a moderately low inflation of around 2-3% as the benchmark around which monetary policies are made. This is because the opposite of inflation, **deflation**, actually discourages consumption and also indicates a lack of growth in the economy. If the price level decreases, consumers would want to delay their consumption to get a lower price, businesses are then forced to lower prices to make their products more attractive. Expectation of deflation manifests and strengthens itself as discussed above which prevents economic growth due to low consumption and investment. 

This 2-3% inflation target, therefore, presents itself as a "buffer" against inflation. It works by (1) taking into accounts [[time lags]] in policy decisions, (2) assuring that future inflation will be fixed which **anchors** expectation, and (3) signalling to the market there is always unfulfilled demand which encourages business activities. It is also small enough that it does not erode purchasing power quickly, ensuring the stability of the system. 

## 3. You pay for getting a job? 

In his 1936 magnum opus A General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, John Maynard Keynes has suggested that there could be demand-pull inflation when the economy approaches full employment. An analogy for this is a car which overheats as it approaches max speed. This relationship was apparently confirmed by Bill Phillips in 1958 where he showed there is an inverse relationship between wage and unemployment, and it was subsequently called [[Phillip's Curve]]. Keynes' ideas, along with Phillip's Curve, advocated for the increasing involvement of the government in the economy using budget deficit to lower [[unemployment]], with an understanding that this will be limited by inflation. The adoption of this paradigm during the 50s and 60s has seen huge success with unprecedented economic stability and prosperity, a period which has been commonly referred to as the Golden Era of Capitalism. 

Despite its popularity, [[Keynesian economics]] were abandoned in the 70s due to The Great Stagflation which, according to its most vocal critics, has invalidated the theory. The 1973 and 1979 oil shock led to a surge in oil price and therefore production and transportation costs, leading to weak business  environment, mass layoff, and against the theory's prediction, a rise in both inflation and unemployment. [[Neoclassical economics]], which discouraged government intervention except for crucial public services, regained its popularity, and a surge of austerity spending and the squashing of labor unions which are the trademark of Ronald Reagan's and Margaret Thatcher's policy has helped restabilize the economy. 

## Implementation in the game

In the game, the AD-AS model is used to calculate inflation and [[GDP]], where the two curves are represented by Income and Output respectively. As these two variables change, they their corresponding curves, from which the new equilibrium price and real GDP are obtained. The precise way in which inflation and real GDP are calculated depends on (1) the rate of change of Income relative to Output, and (2) the elasticities of the curves which are parameters.
