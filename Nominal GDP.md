## Theory

In theory, income must be equal to output, on the principle that all that is earned must be all that is be produced, counting all non-liquid stock in an economy. However, calculating GDP using income, which is the accounting identity $Y = C + G + I + (X - M)$, is more popular as it layouts the basic working of an economy through its correspondence with the Circular Model. 

In this model, there are three actors: Households, Firms, and the Government. Households provide means of production to and receive income from firms; firms receive means of production from households and each other, and provide goods and services to households and each other. Means of production are the things that are required to produce goods and services, and it comprise labor and capital, where labor is human work and capital is everything else: funds, machinery, equipment, technology, know-how, land, etc. At the center is the Government who regulates production activities and redistribute income. According to the income identity, consumption C accounts for labor wages and dividends, investment I is the portion of firm profits that is reinvested in itself to grow its production, government G is the spending of the government using income and profit taxes and credit raised from government bonds, and X - M is the surplus gained from trade, which can be understood as foreign consumption of our country's exported goods minus domestic consumption of imported goods. Note that import is deducted because it has already been accounted in consumption. 

In mainstream economics, growth is still a mystery. 

Given this context, we identify firm reinvestment as the engine for output and income growth. How can output and income grow together? Firm reinvestment can either mean employing more of the population, expanding the total capital stock, or developing new technology which lowers cost of production. In the first case, it will obviously lead to higher income. In the second and third case, 

In economics, growth remains a mystery. 
## Implementation in the game

In the game, GDP is calculated along with inflation using AD-AS model. Income and Output in the game stands for AD and AS, whose calculations take inspiration from both [[Keynesian]] and [[Neoclassical]] economics. Income is the sum of Consumption, Investment, Government Expenditure, and Net Exports. The baseline growth of consumption, investment, and imports depends on last year nominal GDP growth meant to represent induced variables in the Injection-Leakage model, and these growth rates are modified by inflation, debt level, interest rate, and exchange rate. Output, on the other hand, is calculated using the growth rate of capital, labor, and technology based on the Cobb-Douglas functional form. The change in income and output shifts AD and AS so that it will result in new equilibrium nominal output.
